What was applied to random_forest for a better output.

First the reasons.

The Diagnosis: What Do the Results Tell Us?
First, let's look at the symptoms from your final report for the Random Forest model:
Precision: ~0.49 (Reasonable)
Recall: ~0.01 (Catastrophically low)
F1-Score: ~0.02 (As a result, very poor)
This pattern—decent precision combined with abysmal recall—tells us one thing very clearly: the model is extremely conservative and risk-averse.
In Layman's Terms: The model has learned to be terrified of being wrong when it predicts "Yes." It will only predict that a customer will subscribe if the evidence is absolutely overwhelming. As a result, it correctly identifies a few slam-dunk cases (decent precision) but misses the vast majority of potential customers, even those who are good leads (terrible recall). It's so afraid of false alarms that it lets almost everyone get away.
The Root Causes: Why Is It Behaving This Way?
There are three likely culprits working together to cause this problem.
1. Lack of Hyperparameter Tuning (The Biggest Factor)
The Problem: We have been training the RandomForestClassifier with its default "factory settings" (e.g., n_estimators=100). A default Random Forest is not optimized for a highly imbalanced, high-dimensional dataset. The default settings often encourage the individual decision trees to grow very deep and complex.
Why it Hurts: These overly complex trees are brilliant at finding patterns. The problem is, in our SMOTE-balanced training set, they become too good. They learn hyper-specific rules to identify the synthetic "Yes" data. When they see the real, messy test data, those perfect rules don't apply, so the trees default to the overwhelmingly common "No" class.
Analogy: It's like a detective who was trained exclusively on textbook cases. When they face a real-world crime scene that isn't perfect, they are unable to make a judgment and assume nothing happened.
2. The "Curse of Dimensionality" and Feature Noise
The Problem: Our advanced feature engineering has created a very wide dataset (likely 60+ features). Random Forest works by considering only a random subset of these features at each split in a tree.
Why it Hurts: If many of our engineered features are redundant or noisy, the random subsets the model looks at might often be filled with weak evidence. A tree that repeatedly sees weak evidence will struggle to build confident rules for the minority class, again leading it to favor the majority class.
Analogy: It's like asking an expert for their opinion but only allowing them to look at 5 random pages from a 60-page report each time. If they get unlucky and see 5 irrelevant pages, their opinion will be weak.
3. Over-reliance on Default SMOTE
The Problem: While SMOTE is powerful, it can sometimes create synthetic samples that are too simplistic or are generated in "easy" regions of the feature space.
Why it Hurts: Combined with Cause #1, the Random Forest might build its understanding of the "Yes" class based only on these slightly artificial, easy-to-classify synthetic points, failing to learn the patterns of the true, more complex positive cases.
The Optimization Plan: A Step-by-Step Fix
We can directly address these issues. The most powerful lever we can pull is hyperparameter tuning.
Step 1: Create a Dedicated Tuning Script for Random Forest
Just as we did for LightGBM, we need to find the optimal settings for our Random Forest. We will create a new script to do this using Optuna.


The betterment.

we are going to A/B test two different philosophies for handling the class imbalance:
Method A (Optimizing the Threshold): We will keep using SMOTE to balance the training data, but instead of using the default 0.5 decision threshold, we will mathematically calculate the optimal threshold to get the best F1-score.
Method B (class_weight): We will completely remove SMOTE and instead use the Random Forest's built-in class_weight='balanced_subsample' parameter. This tells each individual tree in the forest to balance itself based on the specific bootstrap sample it receives.
